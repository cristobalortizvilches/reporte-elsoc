  abstract = {This chapter examines an integrative theory of intergroup contact. We begin with a brief reassessment of Allport's (1954) classic 'Contact Hypothesis'. Although Allport was by no means the first to advocate bringing groups together as a means of prejudice reduction (Watson, 1947; Williams, 1947), his theorizing in The Nature of Prejudice has justly acquired landmark status because of its lucid exposition, penetrating insights, and careful analysis of the social conditions likely to facilitate the beneficial effects of contact on intergroup attitudes and behavior. As we shall show, there is now ample evidence to support his basic contentions. However, the past 50 years have also seen important theoretical and empirical developments of the Contact Hypothesis. In this article, we aim to provide a critical assessment of these developments, focusing mainly on our own model, which provided the point of departure for our own broad research program on contact over nearly 20 years. Although our original model was conceived partly as a riposte to Brewer and Miller's (1984) principal hypothesis, and it contrasts in key respects with Gaertner and Dovidio's (2000) subsequent alternative, the evidence that has accumulated, both from our own research and that of others, now suggests to us that some rapprochement of these apparently contradictory accounts is not only possible but also highly desirable. Later in the article, we discuss how this might be achieved. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Ambivalent Sexism Theory distinguishes between hostile and `` benevolent'' sexism (each addresses issues of power, gender differentiation, and sexuality). Benevolent sexism encompasses subjectively positive (for the sexist) attitudes toward women in traditional roles: protective paternalism, idealization of women, and desire for intimate relations. Hostile sexism encompasses the negative equivalents on each dimension: dominative paternalism, derogatory beliefs, and heterosexual hostility. Both forms of sexism serve to justify and maintain patriarchy and traditional gender roles. The validity of a measure of these constructs, the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI), is reviewed. Comparisons are offered between the ASI and other measures of sexist attitudes (e.g., the AWS), with suggestions for the proper domains of different scales.},

Parents' past and current participation directly and indirectly predicted children's protest participation in Study 1, while Study 2 showed a similar pattern longitudinally: Perceptions of parents' participation (descriptive family norm) and approval (injunctive family norm) predicted change in collective action participation over time. Together, results highlight family environment as a critical setting for the intergenerational transmission of protest.},

Results               Although artefactual determinants may enhance a female preponderance to some extent, gender differences in depressive disorders are genuine. At present, adverse experiences in childhood, depression and anxiety disorders in childhood and adolescence, sociocultural roles with related adverse experiences, and psychological attributes related to vulnerability to life events and coping skills are likely to be involved. Genetic and biological factors and poor social support, however, have few or no effects in the emergence of gender differences.

A greater understanding is possible when women's experiences and lived realities across the lifespan are considered in relation to the material and social conditions in which their everyday lives are embedded. The implications of this change in approach for modes of treatment are discussed and some solutions are suggested. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},
